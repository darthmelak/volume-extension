## A volume slider browser(chrome) extension for pages playing media without one  
(also basically any page playing media with video/audio tags)

Inspired by bandcamp web preview, where they left out the volume setting from the player...  
I looked around and only found shit extensions with 600% volume sliders so I threw something together that works mostly
